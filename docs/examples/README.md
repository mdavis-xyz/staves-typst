# Code Snippet Examples

This folder contains code snippets for the docs (`../docs.typ`).
They're separated out so that each can be rendered as a png and inserted into markdown, which is what Typst Universe documentation is in.

This folder differs from `../../examples`. This one is code snippets of individual examples. That other one is examples of entire documents (scale books).
