= Staves Typst Package

Author: Matthew Davis

This Typst package is used to draw musical scales.

For now this is restricted to only one stave (set of 5 lines).
This package can be used to write arbitrary notes, but is not intended to be used for entire songs.

== Stave

The foundational function is called `stave`.
This is for writing just clefs, clefs and key signatures, or clefs, key signatures and custom notes.

=== Usage

#let double-sharp-inline = {
  if (sys.inputs.at("render", default: "0") != "1") [
    ùÑ™
  ] else [
    #box(height: 0.7em, image("/assets/accidental/double-sharp-x.svg", alt: "double-sharp x"))
  ]
}

The arguments are:

#let kwarg_defs = (
  "geometric-scale": [(optional) Number e.g. 0.5 or 2 to draw the content at half or double the size. This is about visual scale, not musical scales.],
  "note-duration": [(optional) Allowed values are "#all-note-durations.join("\", \"")". Default is "whole" note. All notes are the same duration.],
  "note-sep": [(optional) Used to adjust the horizontal spacing between notes. If you shrink below `note-sep: 0.7`, leger lines will overlap. At that point if it's still too big, use `geometric-scale` as well.],
  "equal-note-head-space": [`true` or `false`. Defaults to `true`. If true, note heads will be equally spaced. Some of this space will be taken up with accidentals. If `false`, adding an accidental to a note will shift the note head further right. `true` looks better (in my opinion), but `false` is useful in combination with the other spacing arguments, to avoid accidentals overlapping with previous note heads.]
)

/ `clef`: (Required) Allowed values are "#all-clefs.join("\", \"")". Drawing a treble clef above a bass clef, linked as a double-stave (like for a piano) is not yet supported.
/ `key`: (Required) Two possible forms. 
  - Letter based: Uppercase for major, lowercase for minor, with `#` or `b` appended. e.g. `"C"`, `"Db"`, `"f#"`
  - Number based, with a symbol: "5\#" (or "5s") for 5 sharps, "2b" for 2 flats
/ `notes`: An (optional) array of strings representing notes to play sequentially. Chords are not supported. e.g.
  - "C4" is middle C
  - "C5" is the C an octave above middle C. 
  - "Db4" or "C\#4" is a semitone above middle C
  - "B3" is a semitone below middle C
  - "Bn3" has an explicit natural accidental ‚ôÆ infront of it
  - "Fx3" is an F3 with a double sharp, drawn as an #double-sharp-inline (Formats such as "F\#\#3" to show ‚ôØ‚ôØ are not supported yet.)
  - double flats are not yet supported.
#for (k, v) in kwarg_defs.pairs(){
  [
    / #raw(k): #v
  ]
}


=== Examples

To draw just a key signature, omit the `notes` argument

#example("./examples/D-major-key.typ", "D Major Key Signature", include-import: true)

Here is an example of including `notes`. Legerlines are supported.

#example("./examples/F-major-notes.typ", "F Major Fifths")

Note that accidentals are independent of the key signature. 
For the example of F major, the key contains B flat. A "B" note will be drawn with no accidental, so it is flattenned by the key signature. A "Bb" will have a redundant flat accidental drawn. "Bn" will have an explicit natural accidental.
This behavior may change in future versions.

#example("./examples/accidentals-and-key.typ", "Lack of interaction between accidentals and key signature")

The `note-duration` argument can be used to change the note symbol.

#let canvases = ()
#for note-duration in all-note-durations {
  canvases.push([
    #example(
      "./examples/note-durations-" + note-duration + ".typ", 
      "`note-duration`: " + note-duration,
      include-code: false)
  ])
}


#grid(
  columns: (1fr, 1fr),
  column-gutter: 1em,
  row-gutter: 1em,
  align: horizon,
  ..canvases
)


=== Spacing and Sizing

The `geometric-scale` argument can be used to adjust the overall size:


#grid(
  columns: (2fr, 1fr, 1fr),
  column-gutter: 1em,
  row-gutter: 1em,
  align: horizon,
  example("./examples/geometric-scale-2.typ", "`geometric-scale`: 2",
    include-code: false),
  example("./examples/geometric-scale-omitted.typ", "default (omitted `geometric-scale`)",
    include-code: false),
  example("./examples/geometric-scale-0-5.typ", "`geometric-scale`: 0.5",
    include-code: false)
)


`note-sep` can be used to adjust the horizontal separation between notes, whilst keeping the height of the stave the same:

#grid(
  columns: (1fr, 1fr),
  column-gutter: 1em,
  row-gutter: 1em,
  align: horizon,
  example("./examples/note-sep-omitted.typ", "default (omitted `note-sep`)", include-code: false),
  example("./examples/note-sep-0-6.typ", "`note-sep`: 0.6", include-code: false)
)

`equal-note-head-space` is used to adjust the spacing based on whether there are accidentals.

#let canvases = ()

#let bool-to-string(b) = {
  ("false", "true").at(int(b))
}

#for e in (true, false) {
  canvases.push(
    example("./examples/equal-note-head-space-" + bool-to-string(e) + ".typ", "`equal-note-head-space` = " + bool-to-string(e),
    include-code: false
    )
  )
}


#grid(
  columns: (1fr, 1fr),
  column-gutter: 1em,
  row-gutter: 1em,
  align: horizon,
  ..canvases
)


== Major Scales

The `major-scale` function is for writing major scales.

=== Usage

/ `clef`: (Required) Allowed values are "#all-clefs.join("\", \"")". (Same as for `stave`.)
/ `key`: (Required) e.g. "A", "Bb", "C\#". Uppercase only.
/ `start-octave`: (Required) integer. e.g. 4 is the octave starting from middle C. 5 is the octave above that.
/ `num-octaves`: Optional, defaults to 1.
#for (k, v) in kwarg_defs.pairs(){
  [
    / #raw(k): #v
  ]
}

=== Examples

#example("./examples/D-major.typ", "D Major Scale", include-import: true)

You can write a 2 octave scale with `num-octaves: 2`.
This is probably too wide for your page. Shrink it horizontally with `note-sep`, or shrink in both dimensions with `geometric-scale`.

#example("./examples/F-major-shrunk.typ", "F Major Scale, shrunken to fit the page")


== Minor Scale

The `minor-scale` function is for writing natural and harmonic minor scales.
The usage is the same as for `major-scale`, plus an additional `minor-type` argument.


=== Usage

/ `clef`: (Required) Allowed values are "#all-clefs.join("\", \"")". (Same as for `stave`.)
/ `key`: (Required) e.g. "A", "Bb", "c\#". Uppercase or lowercase.
/ `start-octave`: (Required) integer. e.g. 4 is the octave starting from middle C. 5 is the octave above that.
/ `num-octaves`: Optional, defaults to 1.
/ `minor-type`: Defaults to "harmonic". Allowed values are "#minor-types.join("\", \"")". Melodic minor scales are not yet supported.
/ `seventh`: Where the raised seventh would be a double sharp, configure how it is shown. Allowed values are "#seventh-types.join("\", \"")". See examples below.
#for (k, v) in kwarg_defs.pairs(){
  [
    / #raw(k): #v
  ]
}

=== Examples

#example("./examples/D-harmonic-minor.typ", "D Harmonic Minor Scale", include-import: true)


#example("./examples/Bb-natural-minor.typ", "Bb Natural Minor Scale")

Note that for keys with a sharp, the raised 7th can be written as a double sharp, or a natural of the next note.

#example("./examples/Fs-harmonic-minor-n.typ", "F# Harmonic Minor scale with 7th written as F natural")

#example("./examples/Fs-harmonic-minor-x.typ", "F# Harmonic Minor scale with 7th written as E double sharp")


== Arpeggio

The `arpeggio` function is for writing arpeggios.

=== Usage

The arguments are the same as for `major-scale`.


/ `clef`: (Required) Allowed values are "#all-clefs.join("\", \"")". (Same as for `stave`.)
/ `key`: (Required) e.g. "A", "Bb", "C\#". Uppercase for major, lowercase for minor. Do not include a number for the octave.
/ `start-octave`: (Required) integer. e.g. 4 is the octave starting from middle C. 5 is the octave above that.
/ `num-octaves`: Optional, defaults to 1.
#for (k, v) in kwarg_defs.pairs(){
  [
    / #raw(k): #v
  ]
}

=== Example

#example("./examples/F-major-arpeggio.typ", "F Major Arpeggio")


== Chromatic Scales

`chromatic-scale` is used to write chromatic scales (every semitone between two notes).
The arguments are:

=== Usage

/ `clef`: (Required) Allowed values are "#all-clefs.join("\", \"")". (Same as for `stave`.)
/ `key`: (Required) e.g. "A", "Bb", "C\#". Uppercase for major, lowercase for minor. Do not include a number for the octave.
/ `start-octave`: (Required) integer. e.g. 4 is the octave starting from middle C. 5 is the 
/ `num-octaves`: Optional, defaults to 1.
/ `side`: "#allowed-sides.join("\", \"")"
#for (k, v) in kwarg_defs.pairs(){
  [
    / #raw(k): #v
  ]
}

These scales tend to be quite long, so you probably want to use `note-sep` and `geometric-scale`, and perhaps a landscape page.

=== Examples

#example("./examples/D-chromatic.typ", "D Chromatic Scale")

#example("./examples/F-chromatic.typ", "D Chromatic Scale")

== Implementation Details

This package uses a `canvas` from the #link("https://typst.app/universe/package/cetz", "CeTZ") package.
