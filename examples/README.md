# Examples

This folder is mostly to produce the simple example that goes into `../README.md`, for people looking at the GitHub repo.
To compile that into `bare.png` for the `../README.md`, use `typst compile examples/bare.typ examples/bare.png --root $(pwd)`.

To see more about how to use this library, look at `../docs/docs.typ`.
