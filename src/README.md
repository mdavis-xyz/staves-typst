# Implementation Files

* `data.typ` contains config and hard-coded values relating to musical scales and SVG images
* `core.typ` contains the implementation of the final functions that get exposed (`stave`, `major-scale` etc)
* `utils.typ` contains helper functions calculating things, e.g. add N semitones to a given note
* `lib.typ` is a stub that just selectively imports only what we want to export
